## Rules

  <span style="color: #8a5c1d;font-size:18px">Mages created a space that can be torn. The space will teleport your friendly soldiers to the portal circle on the battlefield. The birth of this great magic will go down in history. </span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff">　</span><br/><span style="color: #3c2a1e;font-size:22px">General Rules</span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;font-size:6px">　</span><br/><span style="color: #645252">1. Formation Layout: Each formation has a unique layout. The Lord can't move the units' positions, but they can place the specified units to the formation, or move the whole formation up and down. </span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;font-size:6px">　</span><br/><span style="color: #645252">2. Special Skills: Each formation has a particular special skill that will be triggered when the backup units enter the battlefield. The special skill level is directly proportional with the formation level. The higher the formation level is, the more powerful the special skill is. </span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;font-size:6px">　</span><br/><span style="color: #645252">3. Formation Skills: Each formation has a Battlefield Skill and a Global Skill. Each one of these skills can be upgraded. The Battlefield Skill will take effect only when the lord chooses so. The effect lasts throughout the battle (It works till the backup units appear); the Global Skill works all the time, which affects the player's stats, even if the player does not choose a formation. </span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff">　</span><br/><span style="color: #3c2a1e;font-size:22px">Battle Rules</span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;font-size:6px">　</span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;font-size:6px">　</span><br/><span style="color: #645252">1. Battle Preparation: Players can set their reinforcements on the Deployment page. A unit cannot be put in \"Backup\" and \"Deployment\" at the same time. </span><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;font-size:6px">　</span><br/><span style="color: #645252">2. Backup Arrival Time: Your backup will appear when 3 friendly units are down in combat (If the deployed units are less than 8, then the number of fallen units required to dispatch the backup units will be decreased according to the deployed units). Summoned monsters will not be counted as fallen units. Backup units have a 25-second pre-CD. The backup skill cannot be triggered during cooldown. </span><br/><span style="color: #645252">3. Backup Battlefield Position: The backup units will appear in the position closest to your units. The specific position depends on your units distribution. </span><br/><span style="color: #645252">4. Backup Arrival: In order to keep an eye to the game balance, the backup units will not be available to all features. Only the specified features support the backup units.</span>
