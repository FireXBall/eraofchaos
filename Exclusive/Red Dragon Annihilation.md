When the Red Dragon has a Dragon Soul, it casts <Infernal Flame>, dealing damage equal to 150% of own ATK to the target unit, and additional damage equal to 20% of Max HP to units inflicted with Burn. CD is 20s. |
  | **1x** <i class="fas fa-star"/> | ? | Increases Red Dragon's DEF by 50 and Penetration by 50 each time an Underground unit is deployed. |
  | **2x** <i class="fas fa-star"/> | ? | Increases Unit DMG by 20% and Critical Hit by 200 when fighting against burning units. |
  | **3x** <i class="fas fa-star"/> | ? | <Dragon Flame> Red Dragon deals 130% of own ATK as damage to enemy units in a large range and inflicts them with Burn, decreasing Unit DMG Reduction by 20% and dealing 2% of Max HP per second for 8s. CD is 18s. |
  | **4x** <i class="fas fa-star"/> | ? | Increases Red Dragon's Unit DMG Reduction by 15%. Each time an enemy unit dies, Red Dragon recovers 4% of own Max HP and Unit DMG Reduction is increased by 4% for 5s. Stacks up to 10 times. |
  | **5x** <i class="fas fa-star"/> | ? | When Red Dragon condenses a Dragon Soul, it gains a shield equal to 15% of own Max HP. This increases the Penetration of friendly Melee units by 200, Critical Hit of friendly Ranged/Caster units by 200, and Unit DMG of friendly Dungeon units by 10% for 8s. |
  | **6x** <i class="fas fa-star"/> | ? | <Burning Rebirth> When the Red Dragon unit nears death for the first time, it consumes all Dragon Souls to gain 1/2/4/6/8s of immunity depending on the number of Dragon Souls consumed (0/1/2/3/4). During this period, it restores 20%/40%/60%/80%/100% of HP, and while immune, its Attack Speed increases by 50%, and its Critical Hit increases by 500. When this immunity effect ends, it additionally casts <Roaring Blaze> once, and is guaranteed to trigger <Dragon's Majesty>. |
