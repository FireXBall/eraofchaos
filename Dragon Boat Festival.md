<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">2. Every Water Domain has %s Magic Rice Dumpling(s). Tap the Magic Rice Dumpling to open it and either get a rare item or trigger an event.</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">3. Every Water Domain is guaranteed to include 1 event. Once the event is triggered, you can sail the dragon boat to the next Water Domain. After arriving at the next Water Domain, you will be unable to return to the previous Water Domain.</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">4. When an event is triggered, you will also receive a generous event reward.

(For details, please see Reward Preview - Event Rewards.)</span><br/>
