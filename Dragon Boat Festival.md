## Rules

  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">1. During the Dragon Boat Festival, a Pikeman was ordered to take a dragon boat to explore the newly-discovered Mysterious Water Domains. In the Water Domains, he found many magical foods called \"Magic Rice Dumplings.\"</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">2. Every Water Domain has 20 Magic Rice Dumpling(s). Tap the Magic Rice Dumpling to open it and either get a rare item or trigger an event.</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">3. Every Water Domain is guaranteed to include 1 event. Once the event is triggered, you can sail the dragon boat to the next Water Domain. After arriving at the next Water Domain, you will be unable to return to the previous Water Domain.</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">4. When an event is triggered, you will also receive a generous event reward. When you arrive at specific Water Domains, you will also unlock new event reward selections. You can select one of the unlocked event rewards per event. (For details, please see Reward Preview - Event Rewards.)</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">5. Magic Rice Dumplings are bound by magic string. Cutting open a rice dumpling costs Magic Scissors.</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">6. Magic Scissors can be obtained through missions and purchased in the Store.</span><br/>

<br/>  <span style="color: #3c2a1e">7. Keep traveling to new Water Domains to earn even better rewards!</span><br/>
